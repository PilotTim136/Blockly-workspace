# GENERAL
## Blocks
Blockly is a tool, used in Scratch for example.
You can make custom scripts and use them.

## Documentation
You can use the full blockly-documentation under their documentation.

## Why only blockly 10?
You can change this to the latest/any version you want by removing "@{version-numbers}" from the script-source.

## How do i add custom blocks?
You should see a JavaScript file named "example.js", and there is a step-by-step guide.

# Why should i use this, instead of the real blockly?
Well, if you are having problems setting up the workspace, this is for you.
I had alot of problems setting up the workspace too, so i got this from a friend (i edited it slightly with autosave and general stuff)


# SAVE SCRIPTS
## Filename extention
You can go to the "scripts" folder, and change the values. there should be an "saveextention" variable at the top. change that to change the extention.

## Loadvalidation
Loadvalidation will use the same variable, to define what type of file it will read.
